# Dice-Roll-Simulator
Dice roll simulator created by using html, css and javascript
The button triggers an animation and generates a random number, which is displayed in the center of the dice when clicked. 
Additionally, the number is added to a history list. To achieve this, I used modern CSS to style the dice and added a JavaScript event listener to the button. 
The listener generates a random number, saves it to an array, and updates the history list.
